This is my module 20 react portfolio assignment. In this challenge I was tasked with recreating my original portfolio with the new and more up to date react version. React is a big game changer I have found myself excelling in it a lot. This language alone has made my school experience alone worht it all and I am excited to continue working with react and many different libraries and frameworks.
